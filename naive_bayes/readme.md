Posteriors function: ![posteriors](https://github.com/gogowenzhang/machine-learning-algorithms-python/blob/master/img/posterior.png)


### How to run:
To test this implementation, I will use 'data/spam.csv' dataset. Information of the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.names)

To run compare the result of my implementation and sklearn's implementation, in terminal: 
```python src/run_naive_bayes.py```
